# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation & End-to-End Authentication

**Outcome:** A secure, runnable application where a user can register, log in, and view a protected dashboard. This establishes the complete project structure and delivers the first core feature.

- [x] 1. Implement the full authentication feature stack from setup to a working UI
  - Set up the mono-repo project structure with /frontend and /backend directories, installing all necessary dependencies
  - Configure .env files for both applications to manage environment variables
  - Implement all required SQLAlchemy models: User, LectureSession, and Slide, and set up database initialization
  - Build the complete backend authentication service, including JWT token management, password hashing, .edu email validation, and protected route logic
  - Create the POST /auth/register and POST /auth/token API endpoints
  - Develop the frontend RegisterForm and LoginForm components, integrating them with the API
  - Manage the global user authentication state on the frontend using Zustand
  - Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for the entire authentication flow to ensure security and correctness
  - _Requirements: 1.x, 8.1, 8.2_

## Phase 2: Core Backend Processing Pipeline

**Outcome:** A robust, self-contained backend service that can accept an audio file and asynchronously process it into a complete set of slide data in the database. This is tested independently of the UI.

- [x] 2. Build and test the entire asynchronous content generation pipeline

  - Implement the asynchronous background task manager (using concurrent.futures for development) with database-backed status tracking (pending, processing, etc.)
  - Integrate the faster-whisper library into a dedicated TranscriptionService capable of processing audio files and extracting word-level confidence data
  - Integrate the Google Gemini API into a ContentGenerationService, including robust structured prompting and response parsing logic
  - Orchestrate the full pipeline: a background task must trigger the transcription service, which upon completion, triggers the slide generation service
  - Write integration tests that verify the entire backend pipeline, from a mock file upload to the final data being correctly saved in the database
  - _Requirements: 3.x, 4.x, 7.x, 8.3, 8.4_

## Phase 3: Frontend Recording & Processing Experience

## **Outcome:** A user can now use the web interface to record a lecture, upload it, and get real-time feedback as the backend pipeline (built in Phase 2) processes their file.

- [x] 3. Develop the complete user-facing recording and processing workflow

  - Build the AudioRecorder component using the MediaRecorder API, complete with microphone permission handling and visual feedback for the recording state
  - Implement the file upload logic to send the recorded audio to the POST /lectures/process endpoint
  - Create the processing status page that polls the GET /lectures/{session_id}/status endpoint, displays progress to the user, and handles final states (redirecting on success or showing an error on failure)
  - Write end-to-end tests for the entire user journey: clicking record, uploading the file, viewing the processing page, and receiving the final result
  - _Requirements: 2.x, 7.x, 8.x_

## Phase 4: Content Management: Dashboard & Editor

## **Outcome:** A complete workflow for managing and refining the generated content. Users can see all their past sessions on a dashboard and edit the slides of any completed session.

- [x] 4. Build the full content management interface for users

  - Create all necessary backend API endpoints for session management (GET /lectures/...) and saving slide edits (PUT /slides/...)
  - Develop the frontend Dashboard UI to list all of a user's lecture sessions, displaying their status and allowing navigation
  - Build the SlideEditor interface, featuring inline text editing for slide content and visual highlighting for low-confidence words from the transcript
  - Implement the user experience-enhancing draft recovery feature using localStorage, auto-saving, and browser navigation warnings for unsaved changes
  - Write integration and frontend tests for all dashboard and editor functionalities
  - _Requirements: 5.x, 6.4, 6.5_

## Phase 5: Final Output: The Export Feature

**Outcome:** Users can export their finished presentations into usable formats. This is a self-contained feature built on top of the completed core application.

- [x] 5. Implement the end-to-end presentation export functionality

  - Build the asynchronous backend export services to generate both PDF and editable PPTX files
  - Implement the required API endpoints: POST /.../export to start the job and GET /.../status to check progress
  - Create the frontend UI for selecting export options, polling for status, and providing a download link to the user when the file is ready
  - Write end-to-end tests for the complete export feature, verifying file generation and the user download experience
  - _Requirements: 6.2, 6.3, 6.6, 6.7_

## Phase 6: Hardening, Final Integration & Deployment Prep

**Outcome:** A polished, robust, and well-documented application ready for its first deployment.

- [x] 6. Finalize the application for deployment


  - Implement a global error handling system on the frontend to ensure consistent and user-friendly error messages across the entire application
  - Conduct a final, comprehensive end-to-end test of all user workflows, from registration to export, to catch any integration bugs
  - Finalize all security hardening measures (e.g., review CORS policies, audit dependencies)
  - Create production-ready configurations, startup scripts, and detailed README documentation for both frontend and backend to ensure the project is maintainable and easy to set up
  - _Requirements: All_
